#### mpv url-overlay

Click to open urls from mpv! Horrifying!

[Here is an example](https://gist.github.com/torque/5af90be72b98bce36a3e).

Does not currently play nicely with the built-in OSC.

Hold `tab` to highlight all on-screen urls. If you already use `tab` for
something, bind some key to the command `mp_url_overlay_show`.
